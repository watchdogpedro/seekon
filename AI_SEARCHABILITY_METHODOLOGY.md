# SeekON AI Searchability Evaluation Methodology

## Overview

SeekON's Orbital Scan uses a comprehensive 4-stage process to evaluate how well websites perform in AI-powered search environments. Our methodology combines traditional SEO analysis with cutting-edge AI visibility testing to provide actionable insights for the post-Google search era.

## The 4-Stage Evaluation Process

### Stage 1: Site Crawling & Discovery
Our AI-powered crawler systematically maps your website architecture, identifying:
- **Page inventory** - All discoverable pages and their relationships
- **Content structure** - Headings, paragraphs, lists, and semantic markup  
- **Technical foundation** - Meta tags, schema markup, and performance metrics
- **Internal linking patterns** - How pages connect and pass authority

### Stage 2: Classic SEO Analysis
We evaluate traditional search optimization factors that remain crucial:
- **Title tag optimization** - Keyword placement and length
- **Meta descriptions** - Compelling snippets that drive clicks
- **Content quality** - Depth, relevance, and keyword integration
- **Technical performance** - Page speed, mobile optimization, and crawlability
- **URL structure** - Clean, descriptive, and hierarchical organization

### Stage 3: AI Bot Testing
This is where SeekON's methodology diverges from traditional audits. We simulate how major AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google Bard) interact with your content:
- **Entity recognition** - How clearly AI systems identify your business, products, and services
- **Content parsing** - Whether your information is structured for AI comprehension
- **Citation potential** - The likelihood of being referenced in AI responses
- **Question-answer mapping** - How well your content answers common queries
- **Knowledge graph integration** - Your presence in AI training data and real-time retrieval

### Stage 4: Comprehensive Scoring & Reporting
We synthesize findings into actionable scores across four dimensions:

**Overall AI Readiness Score (0-100)**
- Weighted combination of all factors
- Benchmarked against industry standards
- Predictive of AI visibility success

**Classic SEO Score (0-100)**
- Traditional ranking factors
- Keyword optimization effectiveness
- Technical implementation quality

**AI Search Score (0-100)**
- Entity clarity and recognition
- Structured data completeness  
- AI citation probability

**Technical Foundation Score (0-100)**
- Site performance and accessibility
- Crawlability and indexation
- Mobile and speed optimization

## Key Differentiators

**AI Citation Testing**: Unlike traditional SEO audits, we actually test how AI systems respond to queries about your business, measuring whether your domain gets cited, mentioned, or ignored entirely.

**Entity Analysis**: We evaluate how clearly your business identity, products, and services are defined for AI comprehension - a critical factor often overlooked in standard audits.

**Future-Focused Metrics**: Our scoring emphasizes factors that matter for AI-powered search, not just traditional search engines.

**Actionable Recommendations**: Every finding includes specific, prioritized actions ranked by impact and implementation difficulty.

## The Science Behind Our Methodology

Our evaluation framework is built on three core principles:

1. **Structured Data Primacy**: AI systems excel at processing structured, clearly-defined information. We prioritize schema markup, FAQ formats, and hierarchical content organization.

2. **Entity-Centric Optimization**: Modern search is moving beyond keywords to entities (people, places, things). We evaluate how well your site defines and connects relevant entities.

3. **Multi-Modal Compatibility**: AI search results increasingly combine text, images, and structured data. Our analysis considers how well your content works across different AI interfaces.

## What Makes This Different

Traditional SEO audits focus on ranking higher in Google search results. SeekON's Orbital Scan prepares your website for a future where AI assistants directly answer user questions, often without sending traffic to the original source. Our methodology identifies opportunities to be cited, referenced, and recommended by AI systems - ensuring your business remains discoverable as search evolves.

The result is a roadmap that optimizes for both current search engines and the AI-powered search landscape that's rapidly emerging.
